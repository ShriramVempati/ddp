Future Scope of Work

Statistical Integrated Vehicle Health Monitoring System
More sophisticated models can be developed for other turbochargers like a dual-stage turbocharger and other components
Engine can be compartmentalized and statistical models can learn the working of engine components
A network can be made using all these models to get a complete Health Monitoring System for the engine making it easy for monitoring and analysis of the working of an engine
Statistical Mean Stress Correction 
Statistical methods can be used to estimate the S-N curve for different materials with high cycle fatigue, endurance limit, multiple slopes in S-N curve, and other peculiar properties. 
These statistical methods help engineers study fatigue without deep knowledge on material properties, especially new alloys.
